Python implementations from my LifeStep biomechanics internship, including: 1) Processing and analyzing squat.mat and cutting.mat data, 2) Extracting joint variables (knee angle, hip angle, etc.) from .mat files and visualizing key patterns such as gait cycles, 3) EMG signal processing: filtering, rectification, envelope, RMS... etc.
